      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>Hi! I'm Hiba Noor, a passionate and dedicated Computer Science student with a solid foundation in software development, data structures, and object-oriented programming. I specialize in building responsive, user-friendly web and mobile applications using modern technologies like the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) and Android SDK. I'm proficient in Java, Python, and C++, and have hands-on experience in backend development using Flask, as well as managing databases with MySQL. I enjoy solving challenging problems and actively participate in competitive programming to sharpen my algorithmic thinking. I'm constantly learning new technologies and love working on real-world projects that make a difference. Whether it’s creating dynamic websites, developing mobile apps, or contributing to collaborative teams, I bring creativity, attention to detail, and a growth mindset to every project I take on. Let’s connect and build something impactful together!</p>
